## Introduction

You're planning to invite friends at your house to play video games but your internet sucks, Steam Cache is your solution !
It provides a caching proxy server for game download content.

What does it mean ?
It means that when you will download your game for the time with your internet, it will cache its data on a local server cache. After this, your friends, that want to have this game too, will download it locally. This will drastically reduce internet bandwith consumption, and will allow you to gain a lot of time !

## Technologies

* [Symfony]() - PHP Framework.
* [SteamCMD]() - Command-line version of the Steam client.
