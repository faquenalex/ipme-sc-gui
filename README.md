## Introduction

You're planning to invite friends at your house to play video games but your internet sucks, Steam Cache is your solution !
It provides a caching proxy server for game download content.

What does it mean ?
It means that when you will download your game for the time with your internet, it will cache its data on a local server cache. After this, your friends , that want to have this game too, will download it locally. This will drastically reduce internet bandwith comsuption, and will allow you to gain a lot of time !
